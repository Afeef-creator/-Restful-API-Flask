        "- Question 1 : What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - A RESTful API is a way for applications to communicate over the internet using HTTP.\n",
        "          - It uses methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform different actions.\n",
        "          - It is stateless, meaning each request is handled independently.\n",
        "          - It mainly uses JSON for sending and receiving data.\n",
        "          - REST APIs are simple, flexible, and widely used in modern web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Question 2 : What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to build web apps and APIs.\n",
        "          - It is popular because it is simple to learn and very flexible.\n",
        "          - Flask requires very little setup, making it fast to develop APIs.\n",
        "          - It supports many useful extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy.\n",
        "          - Developers prefer Flask because it gives full control over the project structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Question 3 : What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - GET is used to fetch or read data.\n",
        "          - POST is used to create new data on the server.\n",
        "          - PUT is used to fully update existing data.\n",
        "          - PATCH is used to partially update a resource.\n",
        "          - DELETE is used to remove data from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Question 4 : What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - The @app.route() decorator maps a URL to a specific function.\n",
        "          - When a user visits that URL, the connected function runs.\n",
        "          - It is used to create endpoints for the API.\n",
        "          - It helps define which HTTP methods the route accepts.\n",
        "          - It is essential for building web routes in Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Question 5 : What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - Flask-SQLAlchemy allows Flask applications to work easily with databases.\n",
        "          - It provides an ORM so we can use Python classes instead of SQL queries.\n",
        "          - It helps create, read, update, and delete database records simply.\n",
        "          - It supports relationships between tables.\n",
        "          - It makes database management cleaner and more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Question 6 : How do you create a basic Flask application?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - First, import Flask and create an app object.\n",
        "          - Then define a route using @app.route().\n",
        "          - Inside the route, return a simple message or output.\n",
        "          - Finally, run the app using app.run().\n",
        "          - This creates a simple working Flask application.\n",
        "\n",
        "          Example:\n",
        "          from flask import Flask\n",
        "          app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "          @app.route(\"/\")\n",
        "          def home():\n",
        "              return \"Hello Flask!\"\n",

        "- Question 7 : How do you return JSON responses in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - Flask provides a function called jsonify() to return JSON data.\n",
        "          - jsonify() converts Python dictionaries into JSON format automatically.\n",
        "          - It also sets the correct content-type header.\n",
        "          - JSON responses are commonly used in REST APIs.\n",
        "          - Example: return jsonify({\"message\": \"Success\"})\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Question 8 : How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - To handle POST requests, specify methods=[\"POST\"] in the route.\n",
        "          - Use request.get_json() to read JSON data sent by the client.\n",
        "          - The server processes the data and returns a response.\n",
        "          - POST is used when sending data to the server.\n",
        "          - Example:\n",
        "            @app.route(\"/add\", methods=[\"POST\"])\n",
        "            def add():\n",
        "                data = request.get_json()\n",
        "                return data\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Question 9 : How do you handle errors in Flask (e.g., 404)?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - Flask allows custom error handling using @app.errorhandler().\n",
        "          - You can return a custom JSON message for specific errors.\n",
        "          - Example: 404 for “page not found”.\n",
        "          - This makes the API more user-friendly and clear.\n",
        "          - Example:\n",
        "            @app.errorhandler(404)\n",
        "            def not_found(e):\n",
        "                return {\"error\": \"Page not found\"}, 404\n",

        "- Question 10 : How do you structure a Flask app using Blueprints?\n",
        "\n",
        "          - Blueprints help split a large application into smaller modules.\n",
        "          - Each module has its own routes and logic.\n",
        "          - Create a blueprint file and define routes inside it.\n",
        "          - Register the blueprint in your main app using app.register_blueprint().\n",
        "          - This makes the app organized, scalable, and easier to maintain.\n"
